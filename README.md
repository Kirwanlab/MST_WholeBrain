# MST_WholeBrain
Scripts used in the MST Whole Brain Experiment

Scripts were written by Nathan Muncy, and edited by Brock Kirwan.

Scripts for steps 1-4 were written specifically for a compute cluster using the Slurm workload manager (https://slurm.schedmd.com) and are organized into pairs of files with a main script file and a submission wrapper script (named *_submit.sh). Scripts for steps 5 & 6 were written to be run on their own without a wrapper script.
